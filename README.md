Data from this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibur013/diabetes-dataset.
We employ two models- logistic regression and a L-layer neural network, which we built by referencing DeepLearning.AI through the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.
We use two types of activation functions- RELU and sigmoid.
